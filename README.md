# Blog Template - Frontend
A simple single page blog template. 

### Usage
This Create React App project is intended to be used with [Blog Template API](http://github.com/benjduff/blog-template-api). 

###### Notes
* To update the API request url navigate to **src/config.js** and replace **baseUrl** with desired url.
* Public properties such as <Title>, <Head> and favicon.ico can be updated from the **Public** directory.
* Individually styled components are styled directly inside the components .js file using *styled-components*. Shared component styles are edited from **styles/globalStyles.js**.
* This project was intended to utilize functional components and hooks as much as possible.

### Why did you create this?
The technical purpose of this project was to improve my skills as a full stack developer and get familiar with react hooks. React development is in high demand and this seemed like the perfect project to maximise the use of hooks and hooks only. On a personal note I wanted somewhere to write my thoughts as they pop into my head while I'm developing other projects. Running this blog template on a local server allows me to keep track of, catagorise and edit any random thoughts I have that aren't interesting enough to make it into Trello or my todo list.
